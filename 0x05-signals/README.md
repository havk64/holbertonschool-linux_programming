# 0x05. C - Signals

System programming & Algorithm â€• Linux programming

### Task 0: Handle signals

The file [0-handle_signal.c](0-handle_signal.c) has a function that handle
a `SIGINT` signal usually triggered by a <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> command on most
Unix systems.

It will print the message `Gotcha! [<signum>]` every time the SIGINT command
is received, where `signum` will be replaced by the signal caught.

Note: The `sigaction` function was not allowed

Example:

    $ make

    $ ./0-handler 
    [0] Wait for it ...
    [1] Wait for it ...
    [2] Wait for it ...
    ^CGotcha! [2]
    [3] Wait for it ...
    ^CGotcha! [2]
    [4] Wait for it ...
    [5] Wait for it ...
    ^CGotcha! [2]
    [6] Wait for it ...
    [7] Wait for it ...
    ^CGotcha! [2]
    [8] Wait for it ...
    [9] Wait for it ...
    ^\Quit (core dumped)
    $

### Task 1: Current handler - signal

The file [1-current_handler_signal.c](1-current_handler_signal.c) has a function
that retrieves the current handler of the signal SIGINT

- Prototype: `void (*current_handler_signal(void))(int);`
- The function returns a pointer to the current handler of SIGINT, or NULL on failure
- The handler remains unchanged after calling your function
- The `sigaction` function was not allowed 

Example:

    $ make

    $ ./1-current_handler_signal
    Address of the current handler: 0
    Address of the 'print_hello' function: 0x4006da
    Address of the current handler: 0x4006da
    [0] Wait for it ...
    [1] Wait for it ...
    ^CHello :)
    [2] Wait for it ...
    ^CHello :)
    [3] Wait for it ...
    [4] Wait for it ...
    ^CHello :)
    [5] Wait for it ...
    ^\Quit (core dumped)
    $

### Task 2: Gotta catch them all

The file [2-handle_sigaction.c](2-handle_sigaction.c) has a function that set a
handler for the signal `SIGINT`

- Prototype: `int handle_sigaction(void);`
- The program print `Gotcha! [<signum>]` followed by a new line, every time
Control-C is pressed  where `<signum>` is replaced with the signal number that
was caught
- `signal(2)` is not allowed

Example:

    $ make

    $ ./2-handle_sigaction 
    [0] Wait for it ...
    [1] Wait for it ...
    ^CGotcha! [2]
    [2] Wait for it ...
    [3] Wait for it ...
    ^CGotcha! [2]
    [4] Wait for it ...
    ^CGotcha! [2]
    [5] Wait for it ...
    ^CGotcha! [2]
    [6] Wait for it ...
    [7] Wait for it ...
    ^CGotcha! [2]
    [8] Wait for it ...
    ^\Quit (core dumped)
    $
 
### Task 3: Current handler - sigaction

The file [3-current_handler_sigaction.c](3-current_handler_sigaction.c) has a
function that retrieves the current handler of the signal `SIGINT`

- Prototype: `void (*current_handler_sigaction(void))(int);`
- It returns a pointer to the current handler of SIGINT, or NULL on failure
- We used the function sigaction (signal was not allowed)
- The handler is unchanged after calling your function

Example:

    $ make
	
    $ ./3-current_handler_sigaction 
    Address of the current handler: 0
    Address of the 'print_hello' function: 0x4006ea
    Address of the current handler: 0x4006ea
    [0] Wait for it ...
    [1] Wait for it ...
    ^CHello :)
    [2] Wait for it ...
    ^CHello :)
    [3] Wait for it ...
    [4] Wait for it ...
    ^CHello :)
    [5] Wait for it ...
    ^CHello :)
    [6] Wait for it ...
    ^\Quit (core dumped)
    $

### Task 4: Who said that?!

The file [4-trace_signal_sender.c](4-trace_signal_sender.c) has a function that
defines a handler for the signal SIGQUIT (Control-\ in a shell)

- Prototype: `int trace_signal_sender(void);`
- The `handler` must print `SIGQUIT sent by <pid>` each time a `SIGQUIT` (and only a SIGQUIT) is caught
- Where `<pid>` is replaced by the PID of the process that sent the signal
- It returns 0 on success, or -1 on error

```
$ make

$ ./4-trace_signal_sender
[0] Wait for it ...
[1] Wait for it ...
^\SIGQUIT sent by 0
[2] Wait for it ...
^\SIGQUIT sent by 0
[3] Wait for it ...
^\SIGQUIT sent by 0
[4] Wait for it ...
[5] Wait for it ...
^\SIGQUIT sent by 0
[6] Wait for it ...
[7] Wait for it ...
[8] Wait for it ...
SIGQUIT sent by 95337
[9] Wait for it ...
^C
```

### Task 5: Description

The file [5-signal_describe.c](5-signal_describe.c) has a program that
prints a description of a given signal

- Usage: `./describe <signum>`
  - Where `<signum>` is the signal number to be described
  - If the number of arguments is not correct, it prints `Usage: %s <signum>` (where `%s` is `argv[0]`), followed by a new line, and exit with `EXIT_FAILURE`
- We were not allowed to have more than 1 function in your file
- We were not allowed to have more than 12 lines in your function
- We assumed that if a parameter is given, it will be a number

```
$ make

$ ./5-signal_describe
Usage: ./5-signal_describe <signum>
$ ./5-signal_describe 1
1: Hangup
$ ./5-signal_describe 9
9: Killed
$ ./5-signal_describe 3
3: Quit
$ ./5-signal_describe 2
2: Interrupt
$ ./5-signal_describe 0
0: Unknown signal 0
$ ./5-signal_describe 100
100: Unknown signal 100
./5-signal_describe 20
20: Stopped
```

### Task 6: Catch a single time 

The file [6-suspend.c](6-suspend.c) has a program
that sets a handler for the signal `SIGINT`, and exits right after the signal is
received and handled

- It does not take any argument
- It suspends indefinitely until a signal is received
- When a `SIGINT` is received, you must print `Caught %d` (where `%d` must be replaced by the signal number), followed by a new line
- After the first `SIGINT` is received, your program must:
  - Print Signal received, followed by a new line
  - Exit with `EXIT_SUCCESS`
We were not allowed to use the functions exit, sleep or _exit
We were not allowed to use any kind of loop (while, for, do/while)

```
$ make

$ ./6-suspend 
^CCaught 2
Signal received

$ echo $?
0
```

### Task 7: Sending a signal

The file [7-signal_send.c](7-signal_send.c) has a program that
sends the signal `SIGINT` to a process, given its `PID`

- Usage: `signal_send <pid>`
  - Where <pid> is the PID of the process to send a signal to
  - If the number of arguments is not correct, it prints `Usage: %s <pid>` (where `%s` is `argv[0]`), followed by a new line, and exit with `EXIT_FAILURE`
- It returns `EXIT_SUCCESS` on success, or `EXIT_FAILURE`
- We were not allowed to have more than 1 function in this file
- We were not allowed to have more than 14 lines in our function

```
$ ./7-wait_for_it 
PID: 98631
Waiting ...
Waiting ...
Waiting ...
Waiting ...
Waiting ...
Waiting ...
Waiting ...
Waiting ...
Waiting ...
Waiting ...
Waiting ...
Waiting ...

```
In another terminal:

```
$ ./7-signal_send
Usage: ./7-signal_send <pid>
$ ./7-signal_send 98631
```
